      <h1>Weightloss Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>Sustained fat loss comes down to one fundamental principle: you must consistently consume less energy than you expend. A sustained caloric deficit is required for sustained fat loss. Any approach that works does so because it creates that deficit, whether intentionally or not.</p>
      <p>Short-term changes on the scale can occur without fat loss due to shifts in water, glycogen, or gut contents. Over weeks and months, however, fat loss still comes back to energy balance. Anyone claiming otherwise is either mistaken or selling something.</p>
      <p>But losing weight is not the same as losing fat. The goal for most people is to reduce fat mass while preserving as much lean mass as possible. Doing that requires managing the deficit intelligently, alongside adequate protein intake, sleep, hydration, and adherence.</p>

      <div aria-label="Summary of key actions" class="tldr-box" role="note">
        <h2>The TL;DR</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fat loss requires a sustained calorie deficit.</strong> Start with <strong>300 to 500 calories per day</strong> below maintenance.</li>
          <li><em>Protein matters.</em> Aim for <strong>1.2 to 1.6 g per kg</strong> of body weight per day. Go higher if you are lean, resistance training, or very active.</li>
          <li><em>Pick a meal plan you can stick to.</em> Intermittent fasting, continuous calorie restriction, low carb, or other approaches all work if they create a deficit.</li>
          <li><em>Track consistently.</em> Log food intake and body weight regularly. Accuracy and consistency beat guesswork.</li>
          <li><em>Sleep is when the magic happens.</em> Target <strong>7 to 9 hours</strong> per night to support fat loss and muscle retention. This is non-negotiable.</li>
          <li><em>Stay hydrated.</em> Aim for roughly <strong>2 to 3 litres of water per day</strong>, including water with meals. Adjust for body size, climate, and activity.</li>
          <li><em>Adjust based on results.</em> If you are not losing <strong>0.5 to 1 percent</strong> of body weight per week after two weeks, reduce intake by <strong>100 to 200 calories</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id="energy-balance">Energy Balance</h2>
      <p>The human body obeys the laws of thermodynamics. When energy intake is chronically lower than energy expenditure, stored energy must be mobilised. Over time, this comes predominantly from fat stores, with some contribution from lean tissue.</p>
      <p>Multiple analyses confirm that weight loss requires a negative energy balance, regardless of dietary pattern. When calorie intake is matched, different diets produce similar weight loss outcomes.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 10" href="#ref-10">10</a>]</p>
      <p>A 2007 paper summarised this bluntly: "independently of the method for weight loss, the negative energy balance alone is responsible for weight reduction."[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 1" href="#ref-1">1</a>] Whether you fast, count macros, or follow another structured approach, if you are not in a sustained deficit, you will not achieve sustained fat loss.</p>

        <h2 id="tdee-heading">What Is TDEE and How to Estimate It</h2>
        <p>To create a calorie deficit, you first need a reasonable estimate of how many calories you burn per day. That estimate is your <strong>TDEE</strong> (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).</p>
        <h3 id="tdee-what-it-is">What TDEE means</h3>
        <p>TDEE is the total energy your body uses in a day. It is made up of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate):</em> energy used at rest to keep you alive.</li>
          <li>NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis): day-to-day movement outside formal exercise, including work, walking, standing, and general activity.</li>
          <li><em>EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis):</em> planned training such as the gym, running, sport, or cycling.</li>
          <li><em>TEF (Thermic Effect of Food):</em> energy used to digest and process food.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most people underestimate or overestimate TDEE because they focus on exercise and ignore NEAT.
          For many adults, NEAT is the biggest swing factor between “sedentary” and “very active”.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tdee-how-to-calculate">How to calculate an initial TDEE estimate</h3>
        <p>
          In practice, the simplest approach is to estimate your BMR first, then adjust it based on how you actually live and move day to day.
          Treat the output as a starting range, not a perfect number.
        </p>

        <h4 id="tdee-step-1">Step 1: Estimate BMR (Mifflin–St Jeor)</h4>
        <p>Use your sex, age, height, and weight to estimate BMR:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Men:</em>
            <span>BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) + 5</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Women:</em>
            <span>BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) − 161</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="tdee-step-2">Step 2: Adjust for your actual activity</h4>
        <p>
          Many online calculators ask you to pick an activity level. The problem is that labels like “moderately active"
          often reflect <em>exercise sessions</em>, not <em>total daily movement</em>. A better approach is to anchor your estimate
          to step count and occupation.
        </p>
        <p>Use these step-count bands as a rough guide, then adjust based on how physical your work is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Under 5,000 steps per day:</strong> generally sedentary.</li>
          <li><strong>5,000 to 8,000:</strong> lightly active.</li>
          <li><strong>8,000 to 12,000:</strong> moderately active.</li>
          <li><strong>12,000 to 18,000:</strong> very active.</li>
          <li><strong>20,000 or more:</strong> extremely active.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you use an activity multiplier, choose it based on the above reality check:
          <strong>1.2 to 1.3</strong> (sedentary), <strong>1.35 to 1.5</strong> (light), <strong>1.55 to 1.7</strong> (moderate),
          <strong>1.75 to 1.9</strong> (very active to extremely active). Treat this as an estimate, not a promise.
        </p>

        <h3 id="tdee-examples">Examples</h3>
        <article aria-labelledby="tdee-example-1">
          <h4 id="tdee-example-1">Example A: High-movement job (lawnmowing business)</h4>
          <p>
            A person running a lawnmowing business may average around <strong>25,000 to 30,000 steps per day</strong>, plus frequent
            lifting, carrying, pushing, and bending. Even without formal exercise, their total daily movement is high.
            A plausible starting multiplier is often toward the <strong>1.75 to 1.9</strong> range, depending on body size and workload.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article aria-labelledby="tdee-example-2">
          <h4 id="tdee-example-2">Example B: Low-movement desk job (IT working from home)</h4>
          <p>
            An IT worker at a home office might average <strong>2,000 steps per day</strong> and sit for long periods. Even with
            three to four gym sessions per week, their overall daily movement can still be low compared with manual labour.
            A plausible starting multiplier is often closer to <strong>1.3 to 1.45</strong>, depending on training volume and lifestyle.
          </p>
        </article>

        <h3 id="tdee-validate-and-refine">Validate and refine your TDEE</h3>
        <p>
          TDEE is not fixed. It changes with body weight, training volume, sleep, stress, and diet-induced shifts in daily movement.
          The most reliable way to refine your estimate is to test it against real data.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Track calorie intake as accurately as you can for <strong>14 to 21 days</strong>.
            Include oils, sauces, drinks, and snacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weigh daily under consistent conditions (morning, after the bathroom), then focus on the <em>trend</em>
            (for example a 7-day average), not single days.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your trend weight is stable, your average intake is close to your TDEE.
            If weight is falling, you are in a deficit. If rising, you are in a surplus.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Once you have a reasonable TDEE estimate, you can set a deficit (for example 300 to 500 calories per day) and adjust
          based on outcomes.

        </p>
      </section>
      <h2 id="deficit-size">The Deficit Size Matters</h2>
      <p>How aggressive should the deficit be? The evidence consistently favours moderation.</p>
      <p>If you have not estimated your maintenance calories yet, start with <a href="#tdee">the TDEE section</a> and come back here once you have a reasonable starting point.</p>
      <p>A 2021 meta-analysis found that energy deficiency impairs gains in lean mass during resistance training, even though strength can still improve.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 3" href="#ref-3">3</a>] In practical terms, as deficits grow larger, it becomes progressively harder to gain or preserve lean tissue during training.</p>
      <p>Very low-calorie diets under 800 kcal per day do produce rapid weight loss, but at a cost. A 2024 systematic review reported that <strong>approximately 25 to 27 percent of total weight lost under these protocols comes from muscle mass</strong>, even when protein intake is adequate.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 5" href="#ref-5">5</a>] Outcomes vary by population and training status, but the trade-off is clear.</p>
      <p>For most people aiming to lose fat while preserving lean mass, a <strong>moderate deficit of roughly 300 to 500 calories per day</strong> provides the best balance between effectiveness and muscle retention.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 3" href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 4" href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>]</p>

      <h2 id="protein">Protein: Your Muscle Insurance Policy</h2>
      <p>Protein intake during weight loss is not optional if lean mass preservation matters.</p>
      <p>The evidence shows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During energy restriction, protein intakes of <strong>1.2 to 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day</strong> preserve lean mass better than standard recommendations[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 11" href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 12" href="#ref-12">12</a>]</li>
        <li>Resistance-trained, very lean, or highly active individuals may benefit from higher intakes, up to <strong>1.6 to 2.4 g/kg/day</strong>, particularly during aggressive cuts[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 15" href="#ref-15">15</a>]</li>
        <li>A 2024 meta-analysis found that protein intake above approximately <strong>1.3 g/kg/day</strong> during weight loss was associated with better muscle mass preservation, while intake below <strong>1.0 g/kg/day</strong> carried higher risk of muscle loss[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 11" href="#ref-11">11</a>]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Protein supports muscle retention through several mechanisms. It is more satiating than carbohydrate or fat, helping with adherence to the deficit. It has a higher thermic effect, modestly increasing energy expenditure. Most importantly, it supplies the amino acids required to maintain muscle protein synthesis during periods of energy restriction, especially when combined with resistance training.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 13" href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 14" href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 17" href="#ref-17">17</a>]</p>

      <h2 id="sleep">Sleep: The Overlooked Variable</h2>
      <p>Sleep has a measurable impact on body composition during weight loss.</p>
      <p>In a controlled trial, participants undergoing the same calorie restriction lost significantly less fat when sleeping <strong>5.5 hours per night compared with 8.5 hours</strong>, despite identical energy intake.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 21" href="#ref-21">21</a>] Short sleep shifted weight loss away from fat and toward lean tissue.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms are well documented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep restriction disrupts appetite regulation and increases energy intake, although individual hormone responses vary[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 18" href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 20" href="#ref-20">20</a>]</li>
        <li>Insufficient sleep impairs glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 23" href="#ref-23">23</a>]</li>
        <li>Restricted sleep alters substrate utilisation, reducing fat oxidation[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 22" href="#ref-22">22</a>]</li>
        <li>Poor sleep increases consumption of energy-dense foods[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 18" href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 25" href="#ref-25">25</a>]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A 2023 longitudinal study found that insufficient sleep predicted poorer weight loss maintenance after one year, independent of other behavioural factors.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 19" href="#ref-19">19</a>] For fat loss and maintenance, prioritising <strong>7 to 9 hours of quality sleep</strong> is not optional.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 24" href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 26" href="#ref-26">26</a>]</p>

      <h2 id="hydration">Hydration: Simple but Supportive</h2>
      <p>Adequate hydration supports weight loss primarily by improving appetite control, dietary adherence, and metabolic function.</p>
      <p>Evidence indicates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drinking approximately <strong>500 ml of water before meals</strong> can reduce perceived hunger and energy intake, particularly in middle-aged and older adults[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 28" href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 33" href="#ref-33">33</a>]</li>
        <li>A 12-week intervention found that participants who drank water before meals lost around <strong>2 kg more</strong> than those who did not, under otherwise similar conditions[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 28" href="#ref-28">28</a>]</li>
        <li>Adequate hydration supports normal metabolic processes and exercise performance, which indirectly supports fat loss adherence[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 27" href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 31" href="#ref-31">31</a>]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The adequate intake recommendations for total water are approximately <strong>2.7 litres per day for women</strong> and <strong>3.7 litres per day for men</strong>, including water from food sources.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 32" href="#ref-32">32</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 34" href="#ref-34">34</a>] You do not need to overcomplicate this. Drink when thirsty, include water with meals, and aim for pale yellow urine.</p>

      <h2 id="adherence">Adherence: The Real Game</h2>
      <p>No protocol works if you cannot stick to it. Adherence explains far more of weight loss success than diet style.</p>

      <h3>Available Protocols</h3>
      <p>In real life, people tend to create a calorie deficit in a few common ways:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Continuous Energy Restriction (CER)</em><br/>
        Daily calorie reduction of roughly 20 to 30 percent from maintenance.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 8" href="#ref-8">8</a>]
      </p>
      <p><em>Intermittent Fasting Variants</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Time-Restricted Eating (TRE)</em>: Eating within a daily window of 6 to 10 hours[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 8" href="#ref-8">8</a>]</li>
        <li><em>Alternate Day Fasting (ADF)</em>: Alternating normal intake days with days at roughly 20 to 30 percent of normal intake[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 8" href="#ref-8">8</a>]</li>
        <li><strong>5:2 Method</strong>: Five days of normal eating, two non-consecutive low-calorie days[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 9" href="#ref-9">9</a>]</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Macronutrient-Focused Approaches</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High protein or lower carbohydrate patterns[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>]</li>
        <li>Ketogenic diets[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>]</li>
        <li>LeanGains style protocols</li>
        <li>Paleo-style whole food approaches[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>]</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What the Research Shows</h3>
      <p>A 2024 network meta-analysis of 47 randomised controlled trials found that all major caloric restriction strategies produced weight loss. ADF showed slightly greater short-term loss, but <strong>differences were small and not clinically meaningful long term</strong>.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 8" href="#ref-8">8</a>]</p>
      <p>Another 2024 meta-analysis comparing fasting-based strategies with continuous restriction found <em>similar weight loss at six months</em>, with fasting showing a modest short-term advantage that did not persist.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 9" href="#ref-9">9</a>]</p>
      <p>In practice, the best diet is the one you can follow consistently.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 6" href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 9" href="#ref-9">9</a>]</p>

      <h3>Finding Your Protocol</h3>
      <p>Choose based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily schedule and lifestyle</li>
        <li>Preference for structure versus flexibility</li>
        <li>Prior success or failure</li>
        <li>Training demands</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The physiology is secondary to adherence.</p>

      <h3>The Partner Effect</h3>
      <p>Aligned eating patterns within a household reduce friction and increase long-term compliance. Protocols do not need to be identical, only compatible.</p>

      <h2 id="tracking">Track Everything: Measurement Drives Results</h2>
      <p>Self-reported intake is notoriously unreliable. Substantial underreporting is common, particularly in people with overweight or obesity, and large errors have been documented.[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 35" href="#ref-35">35</a>]</p>
      <p>People who consistently track what they eat tend to lose more weight and keep it off for longer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Greater adherence to food tracking predicts greater weight loss and maintenance[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 36" href="#ref-36">36</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 37" href="#ref-37">37</a>]</li>
        <li>Higher frequency of tracking is associated with better results, regardless of method[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 41" href="#ref-41">41</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 42" href="#ref-42">42</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 43" href="#ref-43">43</a>]</li>

      </ul>
      <p>What to track:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Food intake</em>: including oils, sauces, drinks, and incidental bites[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 35" href="#ref-35">35</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 45" href="#ref-45">45</a>]</li>
        <li><em>Body weight</em>: at least weekly, ideally daily under consistent conditions[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 38" href="#ref-38">38</a>]</li>
        <li><em>Protein intake</em>: as a distinct daily target[<a aria-label="Jump to reference 37" href="#ref-37">37</a>,<a aria-label="Jump to reference 44" href="#ref-44">44</a>]</li>
      </ul>

          <li><em>Water retention:</em> Changes in sodium intake, carbohydrate intake, inflammation, stress, or hormonal cycles can shift body water by 1 to 2 kg within days.</li>
          <li><em>Glycogen storage:</em> Stored carbohydrate binds several times its weight in water. Increasing or reducing carbohydrate intake can move the scale quickly without any fat change.</li>
          <li><em>Gut contents:</em> Fibre intake, meal timing, and digestion alter how much material is physically present in the gastrointestinal tract.</li>
          <li><em>Training effects:</em> Resistance training causes temporary inflammation and water retention in muscle tissue, which can mask fat loss on the scale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because fat loss occurs slowly, often at 0.5 to 1 percent of body weight per week,
          these faster moving variables can completely obscure real progress when weight is
          assessed over short time frames.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box" role="note" aria-label="Tip">
          <p>
            <em>Why the scale can stall during body recomposition:</em> If you are strength training while eating in a calorie deficit,
            it is possible to lose fat and gain some muscle at the same time, especially if you are new to lifting or returning after a break.
            For example, losing 5 kg of fat while gaining 1 kg of muscle would show only a 4 kg change on the scale, even though your body
            looks leaner, clothes fit better, and strength improves.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not failure. It is body recomposition.
            In this situation, the scale alone becomes a poor progress marker.
            Waist measurements, progress photos, how clothes fit, and strength trends often tell a more accurate story.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>How to use the scale correctly</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weigh under consistent conditions, ideally daily, first thing in the morning
            after using the bathroom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus on <em>trends</em>, not single measurements. A rolling 7-day average is
            far more informative than day-to-day changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Judge progress over weeks, not days. Two to three weeks of data is the minimum
            needed to assess whether a calorie target is working.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When interpreted properly, the scale is a useful tool. When interpreted in isolation
          or over short periods, it can be actively misleading. Fat loss is a slow biological
          process layered under fast, noisy fluctuations in body weight.
        </p>
        <div aria-label="Hot tip" class="tip-box" role="note">
          <p>
            <em>Hot tip:</em> Track waist circumference alongside scale weight.
            Measure around the waist at the level of the navel, under the same conditions each time,
            ideally once per week. Waist measurements often reflect fat loss even when scale weight
            temporarily increases due to water retention. Seeing your waistline trend down while
            weight fluctuates can reduce frustration and help you stay consistent.
