            <h1>A simple, no-bullshit guide to taking control of your health: lose fat, build strength, and fix your
                metabolism.</h1>

            <p>
                You already know the noise. Fad diets. Conflicting advice. The voice in your head saying you’ll start
                <em>tomorrow</em>. Algorithms feeding you whatever keeps you scrolling. A fitness industry that makes
                money when you stay confused, distracted, and just hopeful enough to keep trying the next thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s what the monkeys are... Not people. But the systems, incentives, and feedback loops designed to keep you consuming
                reels and spending money instead of following actionable advice and seeing results. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is not a fitness blog. There are no before-and-after photos. No affiliate links. No magic
                pills. There are no cookies (virtual or otherwise), you are not being tracked, there are no dark patterns or hidden agendas.
                This is not about biohacking, optimisation stacks, or novel shortcuts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, this is simply the recipe that actually works for fat loss, strength, and long-term
                health, backed by research and explained clearly. You won’t pay a cent. I’ll give you the map. Whether
                you follow it is up to you.
            </p>

                <h2>Here's the simple truth:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight loss is achieved through a caloric deficit. That's it.</li>
                    <li>But you don't want to "lose weight" - you want to burn fat. That means maintaining a caloric deficit
                        while eating enough protein to protect your lean muscle + drinking enough water + getting enough sleep.</li>
                    <li>If you don't already lift weights, it's time to start. Strength training today means independence at 80.</li>
                    <li>Most supplements are snake oil. A handful have real evidence - I'll show you which.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>I'm not a coach, nutritionist, or influencer. I'm someone who figured it out, applied the research, and
                got results. Now I'm sharing the map.</p>
