            <h1>A simple, no-bullshit guide to taking control of your health: lose fat, build strength, and fix your
                metabolism.</h1>

            <p>
                You already know the noise. Fad diets. Conflicting advice. The voice in your head saying you’ll start
                <em>tomorrow</em>. Algorithms feeding you whatever keeps you scrolling. A fitness industry that makes
                money when you stay confused, distracted, and just hopeful enough to keep trying the next thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s what the monkeys are. Not people. Systems. Incentives. Feedback loops designed to keep you
                consuming information instead of acting on it.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is not a fitness blog. There are no before-and-after photos. No affiliate links. No magic
                pills. No cookies, tracking, or dark patterns. This is not about biohacking, optimisation stacks, or
                chasing novelty for its own sake.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, this is the boring, effective stuff. What actually works for fat loss, strength, and long-term
                health, backed by research and explained clearly. You won’t pay a cent. I’ll give you the map. Whether
                you follow it is up to you.
            </p>

                <h2>Here's the simple truth:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight loss is achieved through a caloric deficit. That's it.</li>
                    <li>But you don't want to just lose weight - you want to burn fat. That means maintaining a deficit
                        while eating enough protein, drinking enough water, and getting enough sleep.</li>
                    <li>Lift weights. Strength training today means independence at 80.</li>
                    <li>Most supplements are snake oil. A handful have real evidence—I'll show you which.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>I'm not a coach, nutritionist, or influencer. I'm someone who figured it out, applied the research, and
                got results. Now I'm sharing the map.</p>
