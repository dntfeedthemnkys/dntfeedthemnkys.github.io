            <h1>A simple, no-bullshit guide to taking control of your health: lose fat, build strength, and fix your metabolism.</h1>

        <p>You know the noise - the fad diets, the conflicting advice, the voice in your head saying you'll start <em>tomorrow</em>, the algorithm feeding you whatever keeps you scrolling, the fitness industry that profits from you never quite succeeding.</p>

        <p>This site is not a fitness blog. There are no before/after photos. No affiliate links to magic pills. No cookies. No analytics or tracking. This is not about "biohacking" - you won't end up fucking with your hormones or injecting peptides you bought off Reddit.</p>

        <p>Instead: this is what actually works for fat loss, backed by research. You won't pay a cent. I'll give you the formula - it's on you to commit and act.</p>

        <div class="truth-section">
            <h2>Here's the simple truth:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Weight loss is achieved through a caloric deficit. That's it.</li>
                <li>But you don't want to just lose weight - you want to burn fat. That means maintaining a deficit while eating enough protein, drinking enough water, and getting enough sleep.</li>
                <li>Lift weights. Strength training today means independence at 80.</li>
                <li>Most supplements are snake oil. A handful have real evidence—I'll show you which.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>I'm not a coach, nutritionist, or influencer. I'm someone who figured it out, applied the research, and got results. Now I'm sharing the map.</p>
