        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>

        <p><strong>Congratulations on opening this page.</strong></p>

        <p>
            No, really. Most people blindly click "Accept All Cookies" without reading what they're agreeing to.
            Privacy notices exist because companies collect, share, analyse, and profit from data. If you cannot be in
            control of your data completely, then at the very least you should make an informed decision about how it is used.
            Reading documents like this is one of the few practical ways to protect yourself online.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            <strong>What this document is:</strong> A privacy notice that is intentionally more transparent and detailed than most.
            It is written in plain English so you can understand the trade-offs and make informed choices.
        </p>

        <div class="tldr-box">
            <h3>The TL;DR</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> No Google Analytics, no pixels, no heatmaps, no session replay.</li>
                <li><strong>No analytics or advertising cookies:</strong> This site does not set cookies for analytics or advertising.</li>
                <li><strong>Open source:</strong> You can inspect the full site code on <a href="https://github.com/dntfeedthemnkys/dntfeedthemnkys.github.io/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View the site source code on GitHub (opens in a new tab)">GitHub</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure still processes limited technical data:</strong> GitHub Pages (hosting) and Cloudflare (domain registrar and authoritative DNS) may process technical data (such as IP addresses in server logs, or resolver IPs in DNS queries) as part of operating the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>If the infrastructure changes:</strong> If I enable Cloudflare proxy/CDN or add third-party services, I will update this page and the “Last updated” date.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Good News: I'm Not Tracking You</h2>

        <p>
            There is no cookie banner on this site because you are not being tracked. There are no Google Analytics.
            No Facebook Pixel. No heatmaps, session recordings, or engagement metrics. I have no idea who you are, where you
            came from, or what pages you're reading. That's intentional.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Complete transparency: you can verify this yourself.</strong></p>

        <p>
            The entire source code for this site is publicly available on
            <a href="https://github.com/dntfeedthemnkys/dntfeedthemnkys.github.io/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View the site source code on GitHub (opens in a new tab)">GitHub</a>.
            Every line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is there for you to inspect.

        <h2>"If you don't pay for the product, you are the product."</h2>

        <p>
            You've heard this before, and it's often true. Free services monetise you through ads, data collection, or both. (<a href="https://medium.com/p/699ae6aca511" target="_blank">Learn more</a>). </p>
        <p>
            So let's talk about what "free" means for this site.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My costs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Domain registration (dontfeedthemonkeys.com): <strong>US$10.46/year</strong> via Cloudflare</li>
            <li>Hosting: <strong>$0</strong> via GitHub Pages</li>
            <li>Analytics: <strong>$0</strong> (because there aren't any)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Total annual cost: US$10.46</strong> + my time (invaluable).</p>

        <h2>Who Processes Data and Why</h2>

        <p>
            Although I do not collect personal data myself, running a website requires infrastructure providers. Those providers
            process limited technical data as part of standard internet operations (for example, security logging and routing).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Controller and processors:</strong> For the purposes of privacy law, I am the data controller for this website.
            Cloudflare and GitHub act as infrastructure providers (processors or sub-processors depending on context).
            I do not receive raw access logs from these services and I do not analyse visitor behaviour.
        </p>

        <h2>The Infrastructure Layer</h2>

        <p>
            While I do not track you, the "pipes" that deliver this website (GitHub and Cloudflare) have their own technical requirements.
            I've chosen them because they have strong privacy reputations, and below is exactly what they can and cannot see in this setup.
        </p>

        <details>
            <summary>GitHub Pages (Hosting)</summary>

            <p><strong>What they handle:</strong><br>
            The actual website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are hosted on GitHub's servers through their free GitHub Pages service.
            When you visit this site, your browser downloads these files from GitHub's infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>What they may process:</strong><br>
            GitHub may process standard web server access log data, which can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your IP address</li>
                <li>Which pages or files you request</li>
                <li>Timestamps of requests</li>
                <li>Your browser type and version (user-agent)</li>
                <li>The referring website (where you came from)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What they do with it:</strong><br>
            According to GitHub's privacy documentation, this data is used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic infrastructure operation and security monitoring</li>
                <li>DDoS protection and abuse detection</li>
                <li>Aggregate service statistics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> I do not have access to GitHub's raw access logs for this site.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Data retention:</strong><br>
            GitHub states retention varies by data type and purpose. Publicly specified exact retention periods for access logs are limited.
            In practice, operational logs are often retained for a limited period and aggregated data may be kept longer.</p>

            <p><strong>International transfers:</strong><br>
            GitHub is a U.S. company owned by Microsoft. Your data may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where GitHub operates,
            using recognised international transfer mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Their full privacy policy:</strong>
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Read GitHub's privacy policy (opens in a new tab)">GitHub Privacy Policy</a>

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Cloudflare (Domain Registrar and Authoritative DNS)</summary>

            <p><strong>What they handle:</strong><br>
            Cloudflare manages two things for this site:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Domain registration</strong> for dontfeedthemonkeys.com</li>
                <li><strong>Authoritative DNS hosting</strong> (they host the DNS records that tell the internet where this site is located)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>What is DNS and why does it matter?</strong><br>
            When you type "dontfeedthemonkeys.com" into your browser, your device needs to translate that human-readable name into an IP address
            (the location of the server). Your device asks a DNS resolver (often your ISP's, or one you've chosen) to look this up.
            That resolver queries Cloudflare's authoritative DNS servers (because Cloudflare hosts this domain's DNS records),
            and Cloudflare responds with the hosting destination.</p>

            <p><strong>What Cloudflare may process in DNS-only mode:</strong><br>
            When DNS resolvers query Cloudflare's authoritative DNS for this domain, Cloudflare may log:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>That someone requested DNS records for dontfeedthemonkeys.com</li>
                <li>When the request was made</li>
                <li>Which resolver made the request (typically the resolver IP, not your personal IP)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="small">
                <strong>Edge cases:</strong> Some DNS configurations and standards (for example EDNS Client Subnet in certain contexts)
                can leak partial client network information. This site is not configured to intentionally collect that, but the DNS ecosystem has nuances.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What they cannot see from authoritative DNS alone:</strong><br>
            In DNS-only mode, Cloudflare does not see which pages you visit, what you read, or how long you stay. DNS is about resolving the domain name, not the page content.</p>

            <h3>CDN/Proxy configuration</h3>

            <p>
                Cloudflare also offers CDN and reverse proxy services. If enabled (often shown as an "orange cloud" in Cloudflare's dashboard),
                Cloudflare would sit between you and the hosting provider. In that configuration, Cloudflare could technically process significantly more,
                including your IP address, requested URLs, and other request metadata.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Current configuration:</strong> DNS-only (grey cloud). Cloudflare is NOT acting as a proxy or CDN for this site.</p>

            <p><strong>Data use and retention:</strong><br>
            According to Cloudflare's privacy policy, data is used for infrastructure security, abuse prevention, and service improvement.
            Retention periods vary by data type and service.</p>

            <p><strong>International transfers:</strong><br>
            Cloudflare is a U.S. company and may process data in the United States. Cloudflare describes its international transfer mechanisms in its privacy policy.</p>

            <p><strong>Their full privacy policy:</strong>

        </details>

        <h2 class="section-spacer-top">The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p><strong>What I control:</strong> I have chosen not to implement tracking, analytics, advertising, or behavioural profiling on this site.</p>

        <p><strong>What I do not control:</strong> Infrastructure providers (Cloudflare and GitHub) process limited technical data as part of operating the internet and securing their services.</p>

        <p><strong>What neither service does (based on their published policies):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use visits to this site for behavioural advertising</li>
            <li>Build advertising profiles based on visiting this site</li>
            <li>Sell visitor data to data brokers</li>
            <li>Place analytics or advertising cookies on this site for my benefit</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What both services may do:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Respond to law enforcement requests where legally required</li>
            <li>Retain certain logs for security, abuse prevention, and reliability</li>
            <li>Use aggregated or de-identified data for service improvement</li>
            <li>Share data with service providers under contractual restrictions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>

        <p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use encrypted DNS:</strong> Configure your browser or operating system to use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT). This can prevent your ISP from seeing your DNS queries, though the resolver you choose will still process them.</li>

            <li><strong>Use a VPN:</strong> A VPN can mask your IP address from GitHub (and from Cloudflare if proxying were ever enabled), though your VPN provider would see your traffic instead.</li>

            <li><strong>Use privacy-focused browsers:</strong> Firefox with privacy settings, Brave, or Tor Browser provide additional protections.</li>

            <li><strong>Contact me:</strong> If you have concerns about this notice, please open an issue on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/dntfeedthemnkys/dntfeedthemnkys.github.io/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Open a GitHub issue (opens in a new tab)">↗</a>). I cannot access GitHub's raw logs, but I can answer questions and, where appropriate, help direct requests to the relevant provider.</li>

            <li><strong>Exercise your legal rights:</strong> Depending on your location (for example under GDPR or similar laws), you may have rights including access, deletion, correction, portability, and objection. Because I do not collect or store personal data directly, requests will generally relate to the infrastructure providers’ processing. You can contact them directly:
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub privacy requests: privacy[at]github[dot]com</li>
                    <li>Cloudflare privacy requests: sar[at]cloudflare[dot]com</li>
