            <p><strong>Congratulations on opening this page.</strong></p>

            <p>
                No, really. Most people blindly click "Accept All Cookies" without reading what they're agreeing to.
                Privacy notices exist because companies collect, share, analyse, and profit from data. If you cannot be
                in
                control of your data completely, then at the very least you should make an informed decision about how
                it is used.
                Reading documents like this is one of the few practical ways to protect yourself online.
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                <strong>What this document is:</strong> A privacy notice that is intentionally more transparent and
                detailed than most.
                It is written in plain English so you can understand the trade-offs and make informed choices.

                <h3>The TL;DR</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> No Google Analytics, no pixels, no heatmaps, no session replay.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No analytics or advertising cookies:</strong> This site does not set cookies for
                        analytics or advertising.</li>

                    <li><strong>Infrastructure processes limited technical data:</strong> GitHub Pages (hosting) and
                        Cloudflare (DNS, CDN, and security proxy) process technical request data as part of delivering
                        and protecting the site.</li>
                    <li><strong>No behavioural profiling:</strong> I do not receive analytics, visitor reports, or
                        behavioural insights from this infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Good News: I'm Not Tracking You</h2>

            <p>
                There is no cookie banner on this site because you are not being tracked. There are no analytics
                platforms,
                advertising pixels, or behavioural monitoring tools. I do not know who you are, where you came from, or
                what
                pages you read. That is intentional.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Complete transparency: you can verify this yourself.</strong></p>

            <h2>"If you don't pay for the product, you are the product."</h2>

            <p>
                You've heard this before, and it's often true. Free services monetise you through ads, data collection,
                or both. (<a href="https://medium.com/p/699ae6aca511" target="_blank">Learn more</a>). </p>
            <p>
                So let's talk about what "free" means for this site.
            </p>

            <p><strong>My costs:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Domain registration (dontfeedthemonkeys.com): <strong>US$10.46/year</strong> via Cloudflare</li>
                <li>Hosting: <strong>$0</strong> via GitHub Pages</li>
                <li>Analytics: <strong>$0</strong> (because there aren't any)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Total annual cost: US$10.46</strong> + my time (invaluable).</p>

            <h2>Who Processes Data and Why</h2>

            <p>
                Although I do not collect personal data myself, running a website requires infrastructure providers.
                These providers process limited technical data as part of normal internet operations such as routing,
                caching, and security.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Controller and processors:</strong> I am the data controller for this website.
                GitHub and Cloudflare act as infrastructure providers.
                I do not receive raw access logs from either service and I do not analyse visitor behaviour.
            </p>

            <h2>The Infrastructure Layer</h2>
            <p>
                While I do not track you, the "pipes" that deliver this website (GitHub and Cloudflare) have their own
                technical requirements.
                I've chosen them because they have strong privacy reputations, and below is exactly what they can and
                cannot see in this setup.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>GitHub Pages (Hosting)</summary>
                <p><strong>What they handle:</strong><br>
                    GitHub hosts the static site files. When you request a page, those files are ultimately served from
                    GitHub’s infrastructure,
                    either directly or via Cloudflare’s cache.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What they may process:</strong><br>
                    GitHub may process standard web server access log data, which can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your IP address</li>
                    <li>Which pages or files you request</li>
                    <li>Timestamps of requests</li>
                    <li>Your browser type and version (user-agent)</li>
                    <li>The referring website (where you came from)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What they do with it:</strong><br>
                    According to GitHub's privacy documentation, this data is used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic infrastructure operation and security monitoring</li>
                    <li>DDoS protection and abuse detection</li>
                    <li>Aggregate service statistics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> I do not have access to GitHub's raw access logs for this site.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Data retention:</strong><br>
                    GitHub states retention varies by data type and purpose. Publicly specified exact retention periods
                    for access logs are limited.
                    In practice, operational logs are often retained for a limited period and aggregated data may be
                    kept longer.</p>

                <p><strong>International transfers:</strong><br>
                    GitHub is a U.S. company owned by Microsoft. Your data may be stored and processed in the United
                    States or other countries where GitHub operates,
                    using recognised international transfer mechanisms.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Cloudflare (Domain Registrar, Authoritative DNS, and Proxy for A record)</summary>

                <p><strong>What they handle:</strong><br>
                    Cloudflare manages three things for this site:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Domain registration</strong> for dontfeedthemonkeys.com</li>
                    <li><strong>Authoritative DNS hosting</strong> (they host the DNS records that tell the internet
                        where this site is located)</li>
                    <li><strong>Reverse proxy/CDN</strong> for the A record that serves the website</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>What is DNS and why does it matter?</strong><br>
                    When you type "dontfeedthemonkeys.com" into your browser, your device needs to translate that
                    human-readable name into an IP address
                    (the location of the server). Your device asks a DNS resolver (often your ISP's, or one you've
                    chosen) to look this up.
                    That resolver queries Cloudflare's authoritative DNS servers (because Cloudflare hosts this domain's
                    DNS records),
                    and Cloudflare responds with the appropriate DNS record.</p>

                <p><strong>What Cloudflare may process at the DNS layer:</strong><br>
                    When DNS resolvers query Cloudflare's authoritative DNS for this domain, Cloudflare may log:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>That someone requested DNS records for dontfeedthemonkeys.com</li>
                    <li>When the request was made</li>
                    <li>Which resolver made the request (typically the resolver IP, not your personal IP)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="small">
                    <strong>Edge cases:</strong> Some DNS configurations and standards (for example EDNS Client Subnet
                    in certain contexts)
                    can leak partial client network information. This site is not configured to intentionally collect
                    that, but the DNS ecosystem has nuances.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What authoritative DNS alone does not reveal:</strong><br>
                    DNS is about resolving a domain name to a destination. By itself, it does not show which pages you
                    visit, what you read, or how long you stay.</p>

                <h3>CDN/Proxy configuration</h3>

                <p>
                    Cloudflare also offers CDN and reverse proxy services. When enabled (often shown as an "orange
                    cloud" in Cloudflare's dashboard),
                    Cloudflare sits between you and the hosting provider for the proxied record.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this configuration, Cloudflare can technically process additional request data for that record,
                    including IP address, requested URLs, and request headers, in order to provide security, caching,
                    and abuse prevention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Current configuration:</strong> Cloudflare proxy/CDN is enabled (orange cloud) for the A
                    record for
                    dontfeedthemonkeys.com only. All other DNS records for this domain are DNS-only (grey cloud).
                </p>


                <p><strong>Why it is enabled:</strong><br>
                    The proxy is enabled for protection and safety, including basic DDoS mitigation, abuse prevention,
                    and shielding the origin hosting from common automated attacks.</p>

                <p><strong>Data use and retention:</strong><br>
                    According to Cloudflare's privacy policy, data is used for infrastructure security, abuse
                    prevention,
                    and service improvement. Retention periods vary by data type and service.</p>

                <p><strong>International transfers:</strong><br>
                    Cloudflare is a U.S. company and may process data in the United States.
                    Cloudflare describes its international transfer mechanisms in its privacy policy.</p>

            <h2 class="section-spacer-top">The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p><strong>What I control:</strong> I have chosen not to implement tracking, analytics, advertising, or
                behavioural profiling on this site.</p>

            <p><strong>What I do not control:</strong> Infrastructure providers (Cloudflare and GitHub) process limited
                technical data as part of operating the internet and securing their services.</p>

            <p><strong>What neither service does (based on their published policies):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use visits to this site for behavioural advertising</li>
                <li>Build advertising profiles based on visiting this site</li>
                <li>Sell visitor data to data brokers</li>
                <li>Place analytics or advertising cookies on this site for my benefit</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What both services may do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respond to law enforcement requests where legally required</li>
                <li>Retain certain logs for security, abuse prevention, and reliability</li>
                <li>Use aggregated or de-identified data for service improvement</li>
                <li>Share data with service providers under contractual restrictions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>6 February 2026:</strong> Updated this privacy notice to accurately reflect that
                Cloudflare proxy/CDN is enabled for the A record of this site. The previous version incorrectly described
                the configuration as entirely DNS-only. No tracking or analytics were added as part of this change.
